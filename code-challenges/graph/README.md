## Challenge
### Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

#### AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
#### AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
#### GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
#### GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
#### Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
* Utilized the Single-responsibility principle
* Code is efficient, clean, and testable
