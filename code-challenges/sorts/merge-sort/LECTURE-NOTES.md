# Lecture Notes: Merge Sort

Merge sort is one of the commonly used sorting algorithms in computer science.

It has good performance, it’s easy to implement and understand.

So how do you sort a list with merge sort, how does this algorithm work? It all revolves around the idea that it’s easier to sort two sorted arrays rather than one unsorted one.
