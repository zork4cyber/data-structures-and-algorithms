# Lecture Notes: Merge Sort
#### Author: Alexander White

Merge sort is one of the commonly used sorting algorithms in computer science.

It has good performance, it’s easy to implement and understand.

So how do you sort a list with merge sort, how does this algorithm work? It all revolves around the idea that it’s easier to sort two sorted arrays rather than one unsorted one.

## Learning Objectives
* What is Merge Sort?
* How does it work?

## Diagram
* Divide the unsorted list into `n` sublists, each comprising 1 element.

* Repeatedly merge sublists to produce newly sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

## Algorithm

Describe in detail how the algorithm works.
Include small code snippets to possibly support the points

## Pseudocode

```javascript
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two arrays:  
     
     2. Call mergeSort for first array:   
             
     3. Call mergeSort for second array:
             
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             
```
